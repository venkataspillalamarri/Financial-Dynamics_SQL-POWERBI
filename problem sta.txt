To create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report project with three dashboards (Summary, Overview, and Details), you'll need to follow a systematic approach. Below is a suggested outline and steps to help you organize and implement each dashboard:

### 1. Summary Dashboard:

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1. Total Loan Applications:
   - Calculate total loan applications.
   - Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications.
   - Track Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

2. Total Funded Amount:
   - Understand the total amount disbursed as loans.
   - Monitor MTD Total Funded Amount.
   - Analyze MoM changes.

3. Total Amount Received:
   - Track the total amount received from borrowers.
   - Analyze MTD Total Amount Received.
   - Observe MoM changes.

4. Average Interest Rate:
   - Calculate the average interest rate across all loans.
   - Monitor MTD average interest rate.
   - Track MoM variations in interest rates.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):
   - Compute the average DTI for all loans.
   - Monitor MTD average DTI.
   - Track MoM fluctuations.

#### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIs:

- **Good Loan KPIs:**
  1. Good Loan Application Percentage.
  2. Good Loan Applications.
  3. Good Loan Funded Amount.
  4. Good Loan Total Received Amount.

- **Bad Loan KPIs:**
  1. Bad Loan Application Percentage.
  2. Bad Loan Applications.
  3. Bad Loan Funded Amount.
  4. Bad Loan Total Received Amount.

#### Loan Status Grid View:

- Create a grid view categorized by 'Loan Status.'
- Include metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.

### 2. Overview Dashboard:

#### Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):

- Create a line chart with metrics: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
- X-Axis: Month (based on 'Issue Date').
- Y-Axis: Metrics' Values.
- Objective: Identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

#### Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):

- Create a filled map with metrics: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
- Geographic Regions: States.
- Objective: Visualize lending metrics by state, identify regions with significant activity, and assess regional disparities.

#### Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):

- Create a donut chart with metrics: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
- Segments: Loan Terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months).
- Objective: Understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

#### Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):

- Create a bar chart with metrics: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
- X-Axis: Employee Length Categories (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 10+ years).
- Y-Axis: Metrics' Values.
- Objective: Assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

#### Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):

- Create a bar chart with metrics: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
- X-Axis: Loan Purpose Categories (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing).
- Y-Axis: Metrics' Values.
- Objective: Visualize loan metrics based on stated purposes.

#### Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):

- Create a tree map with metrics: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
- Hierarchy: Home Ownership Categories (e.g., own, rent, mortgage).
- Objective: Display loan metrics categorized by home ownership statuses hierarchically.

### 3. Details Dashboard:

#### Objective:

- Provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data.
- Serve as a one-stop solution for detailed insights into the loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

#### Implementation:

- Design an interactive dashboard with tabs or sections for different aspects (e.g., Loan Portfolio, Borrower Profiles, Loan Performance).
- Include detailed tables, charts, and filters for granular insights.
- Use visual elements to enhance user experience (charts, graphs, etc.).
- Ensure responsiveness for usability on different devices.

By systematically implementing each dashboard with the specified metrics and visualizations, you can create a robust Bank Loan Report project that provides valuable insights for monitoring and assessing your bank's lending activities.
